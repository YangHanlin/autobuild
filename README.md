**Autobuild** is a simple Python script to build a simple C++ program based on one file or all files in the same directory, which aims to fit the interfaces of editors, such as Visual Studio Code.

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- A C++ Compiler (G++ or some compiler compatible)
- Make

## Installation & Configuration

1. Clone (which is recommended because it enables you to stay updated) or download the repository;

2. Add path of the directory containing downloaded files into the `PATH` environment variable;

3. Run command `autobuild.py` to check, which, if configured correctly, will result in the following output:

   ```
   usage: autobuild.py [-h] -t TARGET [-d DIR] [-c FLAGS] [-m FLAGS] [-V] SOURCE
   autobuild.py: error: the following arguments are required: SOURCE, -t/--target
   ```

4. Find the configuration file `.autobuildrc` in your user home directory (`%USERPROFILE%` on Windows or `$HOME` on \*nix), open and edit it:

   - Check whether the value of `cc`, which indicates the command to invoke the compiler, by default `g++`, works as a compiler and as desired. If your desired compiler is not compatible with `g++`, modify `cc-flags` as well to fit your compilerâ€™s interface.

   - Check whether the value of `make`, which indicated the command to invoke Make and is by default `make`, works as desired. You may add `make-flags` to define the flags passed to Make by default.

## Usage

```
$ autobuild.py --help
usage: autobuild.py [-h] -t TARGET [-d DIR] [-c FLAGS] [-m FLAGS] [-V] SOURCE

A simple cross-platform build script for C++.

positional arguments:
  SOURCE                filename or path of (one of) the source file(s)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TARGET, --target TARGET
                        filename or path of the built target
  -d DIR, --change-dir DIR
                        change the working directory to the specified one
                        before building
  -c FLAGS, --cc-flags FLAGS
                        additional flags passed to the compiler
  -m FLAGS, --make-flags FLAGS
                        additional flags passed to Make
  -V, --version         show version information and exit
```
